        <div class = "body-text">
          <p>Latin America and the Caribbean represent approximately 22% of the&nbsp;worldâ€™s forests.</p><p>
The total forest area of this region has&nbsp;been in decline for over a decade. A&nbsp;large proportion of this area is concentrated in a few countries.</p><p>
Countries like Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico have been putting in effort to rebuild their forests.
<p> However, this effort is not reflected in&nbsp;the regional change in forest area. Countries with greater forest areas, like Brazil, have a greater role to play in tackling the issue of deforestation.</p>
