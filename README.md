# data-viz

This data visualisation shows the percentage of forest area by country in Latin America and the Caribbean from 1990 to 2015.

There has been a steady decrease in the total forest area even though countries like Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico have been undergoing reforestation in recent years. This is because the majority of the forest area is dominated by a few countries who are still undergoing deforestation.

This data visualisation shows how incremental deforestation is. Over a total period of 25 years, the forest area has decreased dramatically but there is little visual change when it is compared annually. Despite certain countries having an increase in forest area, their efforts are dwarfed by larger countries such as Brazil. When Brazil is removed from the visualisation, the changes in forest area for the smaller countries become more apparent.
